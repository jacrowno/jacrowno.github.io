        <p class="lead mb-5">Jerry Crownover was raised on a diversified livestock farm, deep in the heart of the Missouri Ozarks. For the first few years of his life, he did without the luxuries of electricity or running water, and received his early education in one of the many one-room schoolhouses of that time. After graduation from Gainesville High School, he enrolled at the University of Missouri in their College of Agriculture, where he received a BS degree in 1974 and a Master's of Education Degree in 1977. After teaching high school Vocational Agriculture for five years, Jerry enrolled at Mississippi State University, where he received a Doctorate in Agricultural and Extension Education. Dr. Crownover then served as a Professor of Agricultural Education at Missouri State University for 17 years. In 1997, Dr. Crownover resigned his position at MSU to do what he originally intended to after he got out of high school--raise cattle. Jerry now works and lives on a beef cattle ranch in Lawrence County, Missouri with his wife, Judy. In addition to ranching, Jerry writes a bi-monthly column dealing with agriculture and life that appears in many magazines and newspapers throughout the Midwest. He has also appeared many times on Public Television as an original Ozarks Storyteller, and travels throughout the U.S., presenting both humorous and motivational talks to farm and youth groups.</p>
